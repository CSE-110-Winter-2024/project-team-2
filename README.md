# Team 2 - Successorator

---

## Project Description

This is the repository for Successorator, an Android application built for round 2 of Mobile Venture Capital's (MVC) startup evaluation. Successorator allows users to input their Most Important Things for the day to help them stay organized and focused on the day's tasks.

## Workflow

Team 2 will meet every Monday and Wednesday right before class at 12:50pm for standup meetings outside the lecture hall. We will also meet every Friday from 3-4pm in the CSE Building to work on the project together and resolve blockers. Notes will be taken at all standups and meetings and uploaded to the `docs/` directory.

The `docs/` directory will also contain our planning for both Milestones.

## Velocity Recalculation

US10 (Choose Goal View): 7 hours together, 4 hours each individually = 2 x 7 + 4 + 4 = 22

US11 (Add Recurring Goals): 6 hours together, 5 hours andy, 6 hours hannah (2 x 6 + 5 + 6 = 23 hours)

US14 (Contexts): 10 hours together (20 total)

Reviewing PRs, giving feedback, addressing comments: 9 hours (1.5 hours each)

Total expected time to complete US10, US11, US14:

- 16 + 16 + 12 = 44 hours

Total actual time spent:

- 22 + 23 + 20 + 9 =74

New velocity = 44 / 74 = 0.595

Velocity going into MS2 Iteration 2: 0.5 (don’t want to overestimate)

### What Went Well

- Velocity seems to be accurate, has been stable around 0.5 for a while.
- Good note-taking, good communication.
- Master branch passed all GitHub Actions tests.
- Tasks and USs all had assignees.
- Equal distribution of work between pairs.
- Good PR reviews, caught bugs & suggested improvements.
- Merges into the master branch are by stories.
- Code quality and testing coverage.
- Pair programming.

### What Didn’t Go Well

- All stories took longer than planned
- Merging changing, testing everything again, resolving merge conflict
- Still forgot to put issue number in commit message for some stories
