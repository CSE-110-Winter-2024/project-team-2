# Team 2 - Successorator 

---

## Project Description

This is the repository for Successorator, an Android application built for round 2 of Mobile Venture Capital's (MVC) startup evaluation. Successorator allows users to input their Most Important Things for the day to help them stay organized and focused on the day's tasks.


## Workflow

Team 2 will meet every Monday and Wednesday right before class at 12:50pm for standup meetings outside the lecture hall. We will also meet every Friday from 3-4pm in the CSE Building to work on the project together and resolve blockers. Notes will be taken at all standups and meetings and uploaded to the `docs/` directory.

The `docs/` directory will also contain our planning for both Milestones.
