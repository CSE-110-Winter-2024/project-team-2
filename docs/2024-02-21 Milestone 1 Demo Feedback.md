#### Things we did well

- Burn up chart looks really good, almost linear. Marcos said it was the most linear he's seen.
- Organization is really good (standups, notes, etc.) (he even made a note for us because of how good it was).
- Master branch passed all GitHub Actions tests.
  - Note: It doesn't matter if branches pass the tests or not. As long as master passes, we're good.
- Tasks and USs all had assignees.
- Equal distribution of work between pairs.
- We had good PR reviews (aka more than just a simple "LGTM").
- Merges into the master branch are by stories.

#### Things to watch out for next time

- In some cases, we moved a story/task on our GitHub project from todo → pending. We weren't docked off any points for this, but next time we need to move them from todo → progress → pending → done.
- Our post iteration 1 post mortem velocity recalculation needs a 2 paragraph reflection (i.e. what we did well, what we need to improve for next time). We weren't docked off points for this because we had a velocity recalculation and notes, but we should do this for next time.
- Make sure every commit contains an issue number. There were no points awarded for this for this milestone, but Marcos said we should still should do this.
- Include the issue number(s) in PR titles. Again, not a requirement, but it would be helpful.

## Testing

- Full score

## Demo

- Everything is good except for one bug:
  - Goals need to filter when the app is refreshed. Right now it only filters when the mock date button is clicked.
  - Need to address this now before MS2 or else it would cause issues down the line
  - Test by setting the date in System Settings then refreshing the app
