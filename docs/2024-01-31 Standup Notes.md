## Notes

- From Piazza clarifications
  - Ucross goals
  - Tasks roll over at 2am, not midnight. Don’t need to continuously watch the date, just need to check the date and time once when the app launches
  - Probably don’t need a user story for speech to text since it’s built into the keyboard. Keep things simple and follow the “Android way”
- Starter code and GitHub project template released
  - Send link in Discord when set up
- No standups Friday since we already have a team meeting
- Goals for Friday’s meeting: finish user stories, iterations, etc. to wrap up MS1 planning
