## Notes

- User story reassignments
  - Keisuke + Vivian will do US7 (show goals in correct order) because it builds off of US2 (cross off/uncross goals) and US6 (how today’s crossed-off goals at bottom of goals list)
  - Ben + Tian will do US9 (UI mock for date)
- Meeting later at 3pm during lab hours to get our code checked over
- More variety in commits and PRs
  - For example, if Vivian does most of the commits and PRs in iteration 1 then Keisuke should do the commits and PRs in iteration 2
